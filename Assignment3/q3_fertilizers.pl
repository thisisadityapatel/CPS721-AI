%%%%% SECTION: minAndMaxList
%%%%% Below, you should define rules for the predicate "minList(List, M)", 
%%%%% which takes in an input List and finds the minimal element there.
%%%%%
%%%%% You should also define rules for the predicate "maxList(List, M)", 
%%%%% which takes in an input List and finds the maximal element there.
%%%%%
%%%%% If you introduce any other helper predicates for implementing minList
%%%%% and maxList, they should be included in this section.



%%%%% SECTION: fertilizersSolve
%%%%% Below, you should define rules for the predicate "solve", which takes in your list of
%%%%% variables and finds an assignment for each variable which solves the problem.
%%%%%
%%%%% You should also define rules for the predicate "solve_and_print" which calls your
%%%%% solve predicate and prints out the results in an easy to read, human readable format.
%%%%% The predicate "solve_and_print" should take in no arguments
%%%%%
%%%%% This section should also include your domain definitions and any other helper
%%%%% predicates (other than minList, maxList, and their helpers) that you choose to introduce.
