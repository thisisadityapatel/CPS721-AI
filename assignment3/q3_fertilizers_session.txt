%%%%% SECTION: fertilizersDescription
%%%%% Put a brief description of your program below
This solution uses a generate-and-test approach with interleaving to solve a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) involving five plants, each having four attributes: fertilizer type, height, number of tomatoes, and yield weight. 
The solution incrementally assigns values to each plant while immediately checking constraints to prune the search space early and improve efficiency.
