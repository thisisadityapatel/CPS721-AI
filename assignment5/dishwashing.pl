%%%%% SECTION: dishwashing_setup
%%%%%
%%%%% These lines allow you to write statements for a predicate that are not consecutive in your program
%%%%% Doing so enables the specification of an initial state in another file
%%%%% DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE IN THIS SECTION
:- dynamic holding/2.
:- dynamic numHolding/2.
:- dynamic faucetOn/1.
:- dynamic loc/3.
:- dynamic wet/2.
:- dynamic dirty/2.
:- dynamic soapy/2.
:- dynamic plate/1.
:- dynamic glassware/1.

%%%%% This line loads the generic planner code from the file "planner.pl"
%%%%% Just ensure that that the planner.pl file is in the same directory as this one
:- [planner].

%%%%% SECTION: init_dishwashing
%%%%% Loads the initial state from either dishwashingInit1.pl or dishwashingInit2.pl
%%%%% Just leave whichever one uncommented that you want to test on
%%%%% NOTE, you can only uncomment one at a time
%%%%% HINT: You can create other files with other initial states to more easily test individual actions
%%%%%       To do so, just replace the line below with one loading in the file with your initial state
:- [dishwashingInit1].
%:- [dishwashingInit2].
%:- [dishwashingInit3].

%%%%% SECTION: goal_states_dishwashing
%%%%% Below we define different goal states, each with a different ID
%%%%% HINT: It may be useful to define "easier" goals when starting your program or when debugging
%%%%%       You can do so by adding more goal states below

%% Goal states for dishwashingInit1
goal_state(11, S) :- holding(brush, S), soapy(brush, S).
goal_state(12, S) :- loc(brush, dish_rack, S), loc(sponge, counter, S).
goal_state(13, S) :- not dirty(g1, S), not soapy(g1, S).
goal_state(14, S) :- not dirty(g1, S), not soapy(g1, S), loc(g1, dish_rack, S), not faucetOn(S). 
goal_state(15, S) :- not dirty(g1, S), not soapy(g1, S), loc(g1, dish_rack, S), not soapy(brush, S),
                        loc(brush, dish_rack, S), not faucetOn(S). 

%% Goal states for dishwashingInit2
goal_state(21, S) :- not dirty(p1, S), not soapy(p1, S). 
goal_state(22, S) :- not dirty(p1, S), not soapy(p1, S), loc(p1, dish_rack, S), 
                        not dirty(p2, S), not soapy(p2, S), loc(p2, dish_rack, S).  

%% Goal states for dishwashingInit3
goal_state(31, S) :- not dirty(p1, S), not soapy(p1, S), not dirty(g1, S), not soapy(g1, S),
                        loc(p1, dish_rack, S), loc(g1, dish_rack, S).

%%%%% SECTION: aux_dishwashing
%%%%% Add any additional helpers here, including any additional rules needed for the auxiliary predicates
%%%%% DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE IN THIS SECTION
place(counter).
place(dish_rack).

scrubber(sponge).
scrubber(brush).

dish(X) :- glassware(X).
dish(X) :- plate(X).

item(X) :- glassware(X).
item(X) :- plate(X).
item(X) :- scrubber(X).

%%%%% SECTION: precondition_axioms_dishwashing
%%%%% Write precondition axioms for all actions in your domain. Recall that to avoid
%%%%% potential problems with negation in Prolog, you should not start bodies of your
%%%%% rules with negated predicates. Make sure that all variables in a predicate 
%%%%% are instantiated by constants before you apply negation to the predicate that 
%%%%% mentions these variables. 




%%%%% SECTION: successor_state_axioms_dishwashing
%%%%% Write successor-state axioms that characterize how the truth value of all 
%%%%% fluents change from the current situation S to the next situation [A | S]. 
%%%%% You will need two types of rules for each fluent: 
%%%%% 	(a) rules that characterize when a fluent becomes true in the next situation 
%%%%%	as a result of the last action, and
%%%%%	(b) rules that characterize when a fluent remains true in the next situation,
%%%%%	unless the most recent action changes it to false.
%%%%% When you write successor state axioms, you can sometimes start bodies of rules 
%%%%% with negation of a predicate, e.g., with negation of equality. This can help 
%%%%% to make them a bit more efficient.
%%%%%
%%%%% Write your successor state rules here: you have to write brief comments %




%%%%% SECTION: declarative_heuristics_dishwashing
%%%%% The predicate useless(A,ListOfPastActions) is true if an action A is useless
%%%%% given the list of previously performed actions. The predicate useless(A,ListOfPastActions)
%%%%% helps to solve the planning problem by providing declarative heuristics to 
%%%%% the planner. If this predicate is correctly defined using a few rules, then it 
%%%%% helps to speed-up the search that your program is doing to find a list of actions
%%%%% that solves a planning problem. Write as many rules that define this predicate
%%%%% as you can: think about useless repetitions you would like to avoid, and about 
%%%%% order of execution (i.e., use common sense properties of the application domain). 
%%%%% Your rules have to be general enough to be applicable to any problem in your domain,
%%%%% in other words, they have to help in solving a planning problem for any instance
%%%%% (i.e., any initial and goal states).
%%%%%	
%%%%% write your rules implementing the predicate  useless(Action, History) here. %
